DONDERS (f)MRI TOOL-KIT: From Image Acquisition to Computation Model

In this hands-on session, you will implement a neural decoder for reconstructing stimuli from responses. We will be using the dataset that was previously used in the following papers:

[1]  
[2]  
[3]  
[4]  

The papers can be found in the ./papers folder. You can refer to them for more details on the dataset and the method.

The dataset contains fMRI data acquired from the early visual cortex of one subject as the subject was presented with 100 grayscale images of handwritten sixes and nines (50 sixes and 50 nines). The fMRI data has been realigned and slice time corrected. Furthermore, stimulus specific response amplitudes have been estimated with a general linear model.

Let's first familiarize ourselves with the dataset. It containes a number of variables:

X -> This is a 100 x 784 matrix. The *i*th row contains the pixel values of the stimulus that was presented in the *i*th trial of the experiment. Note that the stimuli are 28 pixel x 28 pixel images, which were reshaped to 1 x 784 vectors.

Y -> This is a 100 x 3092 matrix. The *i*th row contains the voxel values of the responses that were measured in the *i*th trial of the experiment.

and

X_prior -> This is a 2000 x 784 matrix. Each row contains the pixel values of a different stimulus, which was not used in the experiment. Note that the stimuli are 28 pixel x 28 pixel images, which were reshaped to 1 x 784 vectors.

## Task 1

- Visualize some of the stimuli in the training set, test set and the prior set. Tip: You can use reshape and imshow/imagesc functions.
- Normalize X and Y to have zero mean and unit variance. Tip: Recall that normalization means subtracting the mean of each pixel/voxel from itself and dividng it by its standard deviation. You can use mean and std functions, or zscore function.
- Split X and Y in two parts called X_training and X_test, and Y_training and Y_test. The training set should contain 80 stimulus-response pairs (40 pairs for sixes and 40 pairs nines). The test set should contain 20 stimulus-response pairs (10 pairs for sixes and 10 pairs for nines).

(The solution of the task is provided in *task_1.m*. However, it is recommended that you try to solve the task by youself before referring to the solution.)

Recall that our goal is to solve the problem of reconstructing stimuli from responses. In the remainder of this document, **x** will refer to stimuli, and **y** will refer to responses.

One possible approach to solve this problem is to use a *discriminative* model, which predicts **x** as a function of **y**. That is:

**x** = f(**y**)

We will assume that f is a linear function. That is:

**x** = **B'** **y**

We can estimate **B** with ridge regression. That is:

**B** = (**Y**_training' **Y**_training + lambda **I**) ^ -1 **Y**_training' **X**_training'

where lambda is the regularization coefficient, **I** is the *p* x *p* identity matrix, and *p* is the number of voxels.

Note that we can safely ignore the intercept since we normalized our data to have zero mean and unit variance.

## Task 2

- Estimate **B** on the training set. Tip: Normally, you should use cross validation to estimate lambda. For simplicity, you can assume that lambda = 10 ^ -6.
- Reconstruct **x** from **y** in the test set.
- Visualize the reconstructions. Tip: You can use reshape function, and imshow or imagesc functions.

(The solution of the task is provided in *task_2.m*. However, it is recommended that you try to solve the task by youself before referring to the solution.)

As you can see, the results are not very good. One reason is that we are not forcing the reconstructions to be similar to handwritten digits even though we know that they should be similar to handwritten digits.

To do this, we have to resort to probability theory. We reformulate our goal as finding the most probable **x** that could have caused **y**. That is:

argmax_**x** P(**x** | **y**)

So, we have to define P(**x** | **y**) and find the **x** that maximizes P(**x** | **y**) given **y**. While, this may seem daunting, it actually has a simple solution. We use Bayes' theorem to reformulate P(**x** | **y**) as a product of P(**y** | **x**) and P(**y** | **x**)

P(**x** | **y**) ~ P(**y** | **x**) * P(**x**)

Here P(**y** | **x**) is called the likelihood: how likely is a particular response given that the stimulus was a particular image and P(x) is called the prior: how like is x For example, in this context, a face image or a white noise image will be extremely unlikely to be observed however, a letter will be quite likely and a digit will be extremely likely.

We will assume that the likelihood and the prior are multivariate Gaussian distributions. A Guassian is characterized by two parameters: a mean vector and a covraiance matrix.

In the case of the liklihood, the mean of the Gaussian is given by:

**mu**\_likelihood = ***B'** **x**

As before, we can estimate **B** with ridge regression:

**B** = (**X**\_training' **X**\_training + lambda **I**) ^ -1 **X**\_training' **Y**\_training'

The covariance matrix of the likelihood is given by:

-- **Sigma**_\likelihood = diag(E[||**y** - **B'** **x**|| ^ 2]). 

In the case of the prior, the mean of the Gaussian is given by:

-- **mu**\_prior = **0** (which is a vector of zeros)

The covariance matrix of the prior is given by:

-- **Sigma**\_prior = **X**\_prior' * **X**\_prior / (n - 1)

where n is the length of **X**\_prior.

## Task 3

- Estimate **B** on the training set. Tip: Normally, you should use cross-validation to estimate lambda and Sigma_liklihood. For simplicity, you can assume that lambda = 10 ^ -6 and Sigma_liklihood = 10 ^ -3 **I**.
- Estimate **Sigma**\_prior. Tip: Add 10 ^ -6 to the diagonal of Sigma_prior for regularization.
- Visualize **Sigma**\_prior. Tip: you can use imagesc function.

(The solution of the task is provided in *task_3.m*. However, it is recommended that you try to solve the task by youself before referring to the solution.)

Having defined the likelihhod and the prior as Gaussians, we can derive the posterior by multiplying them. It turns out that the product of two Gaussians is another Gaussian whose mean vector is given by:

**mu**_posterior = ...

Recall that we formulated the reconstruction as the argument that maximixes the posterior, which we derived to be a Gaussian. We will be done once we answer the following question:

Question: What is the argument that maximizes a Gaussian?

.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  

The answer is its mean vector.

We can now plug any **y** in the below equation and reconstruct the most probable **x** that could have caused it.

argmax_**x** P(**x** | **y**) =
**mu**\_posterior =
...

## Task 4

- Reconstruct **x** from **y** in the test set.
- Visualize the reconstructions. Tip: You can use reshape function, and imshow or imagesc functions.
- Compare the reconstructions with the earlier reconstructions.

(The solution of the task is provided in *task_4.m*. However, it is recommended that you try to solve the task by youself before referring to the solution.)
