% Task 1

%% Load the dataset.

load('69dataset2.mat');

%% Visualize some of the stimuli. Tip: You can use reshape function, and
% imshow or imagesc functions.

i = 1;
x = reshape(X(i, :), 28, 28);
% x = reshape(X_prior(i, :), 28, 28);

imshow(x);
% imagesc(x);
title('stimulus');

%% Normalize X and Y to have zero mean and unit variance. Tip: Recall that
% normalization means subtracting the mean of each pixel/voxel from itself
% and dividng it by its standard deviation. You can use bsxfun, mean and
% std functions, or zscore function.

X       = zscore(X);
X_prior = zscore(X_prior);
Y       = zscore(Y);

%% Split X and Y in two parts called X_training and X_test, and Y_training
% and Y_test. The training set should contain 80 stimulus-response pairs
% (40 pairs for sixes and 40 pairs for nines). The test set should contain
% 20 stimulus-response pairs (10 pairs for sixes and 10 pairs for nines).

X_training = X([1 : 40 51 : 90], :);
X_test     = X([41 : 50 91 : end], :);
Y_training = Y([1 : 40 51 : 90], :);
Y_test     = Y([41 : 50 91 : end], :);
